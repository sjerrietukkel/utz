            </h3>
            <h2>
                A good method to check poverty in certain developing countries is the <span>PPI</span>.<br><br>
                In contrary to the poverty line (based on the minimum income in a particular country), the PPI is based on social demographics and the quality of life.  <br><br>
                The PPI is a set of 10 easy-to-answer 
                questions that a household member can answer in 5 to 10 minutes. The questions are simple – “What material is your roof made out of? How many of your children are in school? What type of toilet facility is usually used by the household?” <br><br>
                The scored answers provide the likelihood that the survey respondent’s household is living below the national poverty line in Ghana.
