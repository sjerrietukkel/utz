                    The <span>PPI</span> is a set of 10 easy-to-answer 
                    questions that a household member can answer in 5 to 10 minutes. The questions are simple – “What material is your roof made out of? How many of your children are in school? What type of toilet facility is usually used by the household?” 
                    <br>
                    The scored answers provide the 
                    likelihood that the survey respondent’s 
                    household is living below the national 
                    poverty line in Ghana.
